##About Dataset 
TDatacenter monitoring systems offer a variety of data streams and events. The Datacenter Challenge datasets are a combination of high-level data (e.g. Slurm Workload Manager scheduler data) and low-level job-specific time series data. The high-level data includes parameters such as the number of nodes requested, number of CPU/GPU/memory requests, exit codes, and run time data. The low-level time series data is collected on the order of seconds for each job. This granular time series data includes CPU/GPU/memory utilization, amount of disk I/O, and environmental parameters such as power drawn and temperature. Ideally, leveraging both high-level scheduler data and low-level time series data will facilitate the development of AI/ML algorithms which not only predict/detect failures, but also allow for the accurate determination of their cause.
